General Purpose C Library

Welcome to the General Purpose C Library project! ðŸ“š
Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive C library containing a wide range of general-purpose functions that can be utilized in various programs. From basic utilities to more advanced algorithms, this library will serve as a valuable resource for developers looking to streamline their coding process and enhance the functionality of their applications.
Why a C Library?

Creating a dedicated library offers several advantages:

    Reusability: Functions developed within this library can be reused across multiple projects, saving time and effort in rewriting code.
    Modularity: By organizing functions into a library, developers can maintain a modular codebase, making it easier to manage and update individual components.
    Community Collaboration: This project encourages collaboration and contribution from the community, fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and collective improvement.

Key Features

The General Purpose C Library will include a diverse set of functions, covering various domains such as:

    String manipulation
    Memory management
    Mathematical operations
    Data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues)
    Input/output handling
    Error handling and logging
    Sorting and searching algorithms
